                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Huy Le and welcome to my homepage! <br><br>
                    &emsp;To learn a little about me is that, currently, I am working as a Chemist and am in the
                    transition
                    of becoming a Software Engineer.
                    I made the decision to pursue an education in Computer Science before I have to begin settling down and adult.
                    This decision to pursure this education sparked when one of my employers was looking into automating
                    lab
                    work to better utilize lab personel's time.
                    We ended up finding an lab equipment manufacturer that was capable of building equipment based on
                    our
                    needs and that also meet our style, practices, or techniques.
                    They even integrate their equipment to our instruments and wrap their software around the
                    current
                    software to make equipment compatible with each other.
                    This was really cool to me.
                    Once I was exposed to that, I really wanted to know how I could do that and this is where I picked
                    up a
                    goal of someday becoming a embedded software developer.
                    I hope to contribute to the Scientific Industry by combining my skills as a chemist and a computer
                    scientist one day. <br><br>

                    &emsp;Aside from working and educating, I enjoy spending time with my partner and our dog Jack
                    (short
                    for Mr. Jack).
                    We enjoy traveling to find new destinations for hiking and camping trips since this is the best
                    outlet
                    for our dog's endless will to play.
                    I also enjoy snowboarding and maintaning a saltwater aquarium for my pair of clown fishes.
